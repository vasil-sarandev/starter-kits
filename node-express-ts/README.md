# Minimal Node Express Starter Kit

## Introduction

This is my personal starter kit for Node-Express Apps in 2025.

- Node
- Express
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Vitest
- JsonWebToken

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node > v22**

Won't work with older Node Engines because the .env parsing currently uses the new built-in env parser in Node.

### Running the app

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can now access the app at `localhost:3000` in Postman or your browser.

## Roadmap

1. Add sample tests [TODO]

## Contributing

### Prerequisites

Make sure the ESLint extension in installed in your Code Edtior of choice so you can see the errors.

## Tests

`npm run test`

## Build for product and run

`npm run build`
`npm run`
